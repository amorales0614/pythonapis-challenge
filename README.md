# pythonapis-challenge
Repo for Python APIs homework - two different files for WeatherPy and VacationPy.

Outputs for WeatherPy (PNGs of scatterplots and csv) are in WeatherPy_outputs folder.

Outputs for VacationPy (PNGs of heatmaps) are in VacationPy_outputs.

'output_data' contains original cities.csv provided with starter files - this was not touched/edited in any way.
